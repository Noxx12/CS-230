Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room was the client, and they requested the design of a software application called "Draw It or Lose It." The software is a multiplayer game that allows users to draw a given prompt and compete against other players to guess what the prompt is.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
